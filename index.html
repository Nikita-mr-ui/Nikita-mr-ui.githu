    <p>Belarus is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. Its landscape is mostly flat, with vast forests, rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Forests cover about 40% of Belarus, with birch, pine, and oak trees. Major rivers include the Dnieper, Neman, and Western Dvina. National parks like Belovezhskaya Pushcha and Berezinsky Biosphere Reserve protect rare species such as the European bison (zubr), lynx, and black stork. The climate is continental: cold winters with snow, warm summers with rain and sunshine.</p>

    <p>Belarus has a rich and complex history shaped by many cultures and empires. In medieval times, Belarusian lands were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, later united with Poland in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the late 18th century, Belarus was absorbed into the Russian Empire. After World War I, Belarus became a Soviet republic and remained part of the USSR until independence in 1991. During World War II, Belarus suffered massive destruction and loss of life. Today, Belarus preserves its history through castles, monuments, and museums, such as the Brest Fortress and Mir Castle.</p>

    <h3>The Birch and the Boy</h3>

    <p>Every day after school, Sasha would run to the birch tree near his village. He climbed its branches, whispered secrets to its bark, and watched the seasons change through its leaves. Years passed. When Sasha returned as a grown man, the birch had grown too — taller, stronger, its trunk wide and steady. Sitting beneath it once more, he felt the quiet warmth of memory. The birch hadn’t forgotten him. It stood like a guardian of his childhood, reminding him that some roots — like friendships and places — never fade.</p>
